# MINISHELL

My 8th project at the 42sp and the most huge one rsrs. This is the first project that i do with a partner, that was [Marcus Vinicius](https://github.com/MarcusVinix), and was so cool training my teamwork skills with him.

## **About the Project**
The title is already self explanatory, the goal of this project is simulates a prompt calls [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)). Basically almost most common commands that you do in original shell, you also can do in minishell.  
This minishell is completely coding in C, having a makefile that compile the project and create a executing and use my [libft that is on my profile](https://github.com/jhonatan229/libft_42).

## **How run Minishel**
First things first, you need to clone this repository, enter the folder and run **"make"** to create a executable of the project.

> I tested this project only in unix architecture, so if you is using windows or MacOS, i can't confirm if this application works on this OSs.  

> In this project, i use the library readline, so if your pc don't have it installed, just install with apt-get:
```shell
sudo apt-get install -libreadline-dev
```
After the compile, just execute the file:
```shell
./minishell
```
and that's it, you are inside minishel now, enjoy!!
